// Playwright Test Annotations Example

// Playwright allows you to annotate tests with more details than just tags.
// Annotations provide a way to add context to your tests using a type and
// description. This information is displayed in the test report.

import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";

// Test with Annotation (To Do)
test(
	"Test Logout Functionality",
	{
		annotation: {
			type: "todo", // Annotation type indicating a task to be done
			description: "Implement logout functionality",
		},
	},
	async ({ page }) => {
		// This test might currently not be implemented (marked as To Do)
		console.log("Logout functionality not yet implemented.");
	}
);
